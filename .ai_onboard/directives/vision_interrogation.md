# Vision Interrogation Directive

Guidelines for using the enhanced vision interrogation system to create comprehensive project charters.

---

## üéØ Purpose

Vision interrogation is an **intelligent guided process** that helps users define clear, complete project visions through structured questions. It replaces the simple template-based charter with a conversation-driven approach.

---

## üîÑ Simple vs Intelligent Charter Creation

### Simple Charter (Template-Based)

**Command**: `python -m ai_onboard charter`

**When to use:**
- Quick prototypes
- Internal tools
- User knows exactly what they want
- Time-constrained situations

**What you get:**
- Basic charter.json with minimal fields
- User fills in blanks manually
- Fast but potentially incomplete

---

### Intelligent Charter (Interrogation-Based)

**Command**: `python -m ai_onboard interrogate start`

**When to use:**
- Production projects
- Projects with multiple stakeholders
- Unclear or evolving vision
- Need comprehensive planning
- **RECOMMENDED for serious projects**

**What you get:**
- Rich, detailed charter.json
- Structured through guided questions
- Covers scope, boundaries, success metrics
- Higher vision quality score
- Better alignment foundation

---

## üìã The Interrogation Flow

### Phase 1: Core Vision & Problem
Questions about:
- Core problem being solved
- Primary users/beneficiaries
- Vision statement
- Project name

**Example:**
```
Q: "What core problem are you trying to solve?"
Q: "Who are the primary users or beneficiaries?"
Q: "What is your vision statement for this project?"
```

### Phase 2: Stakeholders & Goals
Questions about:
- Key stakeholders and their roles
- Project objectives
- Risk appetite
- Delivery timeline
- Team size
- Methodology preferences

**Example:**
```
Q: "Who are the key stakeholders and their roles?"
Q: "What are your main project objectives?"
Q: "What is your risk appetite? (low/medium/high)"
```

### Phase 3: Scope & Boundaries
Questions about:
- What's in scope
- What's explicitly out of scope
- Non-goals (what you won't do)
- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Compliance requirements

**Example:**
```
Q: "What is explicitly IN scope for this project?"
Q: "What is explicitly OUT of scope?"
Q: "What are you NOT trying to achieve?"
```

### Phase 4: Success Criteria
Questions about:
- How success will be measured
- Specific metrics and targets
- Minimum viable outcomes
- Definition of done

**Example:**
```
Q: "How will you measure success?"
Q: "What are the minimum viable outcomes?"
Q: "What metrics will you track?"
```

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow

### Step 1: Detect When to Suggest Interrogation

```python
if user_wants_charter():
    if is_new_production_project() or vision_unclear():
        suggest_interrogation()
    else:
        suggest_simple_charter()
```

### Step 2: Suggest Appropriately

**Good suggestion:**
```
"I can create a charter in two ways:

1. üìù Simple template (5 min) - Good for prototypes
   Command: python -m ai_onboard charter

2. üéØ Guided interrogation (15-20 min) - Recommended for production
   Command: python -m ai_onboard interrogate start
   Benefits:
   - Comprehensive vision definition
   - Structured through guided questions
   - Covers scope, boundaries, success criteria
   - Creates better foundation for planning

Which would you prefer?"
```

### Step 3: Manage the Interrogation Process

**Not Your Job**: Don't answer the questions yourself!

The interrogation system will:
1. Ask questions to the user
2. Collect responses
3. Generate charter from responses

**Your Job**: 
- Guide the user to start the process
- Explain what interrogation does
- Help if they get stuck
- Suggest interrogation when appropriate

### Step 4: After Interrogation Completes

```python
if interrogation_complete():
    explain("Vision interrogation complete!")
    show_vision_quality_score()
    suggest_next_step("python -m ai_onboard plan --analyze-codebase")
```

---

## üìä Commands Reference

### Check Interrogation Status

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate check
```

**Shows:**
- Current interrogation state
- Vision quality score
- Whether ready to generate charter

### Start New Interrogation

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate start
```

**Begins:**
- Interactive question flow
- Phase-by-phase vision definition
- Automatic charter generation on completion

### View Questions

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate questions
```

**Returns:**
- All questions for current phase
- Question types (text, choice, boolean)
- Help text for each question

### Get Summary

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate summary
```

**Shows:**
- Collected responses so far
- Vision quality assessment
- Completeness metrics

---

## üéØ Vision Quality Score

The system calculates a quality score (0.0 - 1.0) based on:
- **Completeness**: All required fields filled
- **Clarity**: Specific, unambiguous responses
- **Scope Definition**: Clear boundaries set
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes defined

**Interpretation:**
- `0.9 - 1.0`: Excellent vision, ready for complex planning
- `0.7 - 0.9`: Good vision, minor gaps
- `0.5 - 0.7`: Adequate vision, could be more specific
- `< 0.5`: Incomplete, needs more definition

---

## üí¨ Communication Templates

### Suggesting Interrogation for New Project

```
"For production projects, I recommend using the vision interrogation system 
instead of a simple charter. It takes about 15-20 minutes but creates a much 
more comprehensive foundation:

‚úÖ Structured questions guide you through vision definition
‚úÖ Covers scope, boundaries, success criteria systematically  
‚úÖ Generates detailed charter with vision quality scoring
‚úÖ Creates better alignment for planning and execution

Would you like to use the guided interrogation?
If so, run: python -m ai_onboard interrogate start"
```

### When Simple Charter is Better

```
"For quick prototypes or internal tools, the simple charter template 
works well:

python -m ai_onboard charter

If you later need more detail, you can always switch to interrogation mode."
```

### After Interrogation Completes

```
"‚úÖ Vision interrogation complete!

Your charter has been generated with:
- Vision Quality Score: 0.85/1.0 (Good!)
- All phases completed
- Scope boundaries defined
- Success metrics established

üìã Next recommended step:
python -m ai_onboard plan --analyze-codebase

This will create a project plan that combines your vision with 
analysis of your existing codebase (if any)."
```

## üö® Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Always Using Simple Charter

```
Agent: "I'll create a charter for you"
Runs: python -m ai_onboard charter
```

**Problem**: User misses comprehensive vision definition

**Fix**: Ask about project type, suggest interrogation for production

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Answering Interrogation Questions Yourself

```
Interrogation: "What is your risk appetite?"
Agent: "Based on context, I'll answer 'medium'..."
```

**Problem**: Violates user collaboration - these are USER'S questions!

**Fix**: Let the interrogation system ask the user directly

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Not Explaining the Options

```
Agent: "Run python -m ai_onboard charter"
```

**Problem**: User doesn't know interrogation exists

**Fix**: Present both options, explain trade-offs

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Skipping Quality Assessment

```
Agent: *Interrogation completes*
Agent: "Charter created."
```

**Problem**: Doesn't share vision quality score

**Fix**: Report score and what it means

---

## üéì Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

1. **Assess project type** before suggesting charter method
2. **Explain both options** (simple vs interrogation)
3. **Let interrogation system** handle the questions
4. **Report quality score** after completion
5. **Suggest next step** (planning) after charter is ready

### ‚ùå Don't Do This

1. **Force interrogation** on simple prototypes
2. **Skip suggesting interrogation** for production projects
3. **Answer questions** on behalf of user
4. **Ignore quality score** warnings
5. **Create charter and stop** - suggest planning next

---

## üìà Success Indicators

You're using interrogation correctly when:

‚úÖ Production projects get interrogation suggestions
‚úÖ Users understand the trade-off between methods
‚úÖ Interrogation completes with high quality scores (>0.7)
‚úÖ Generated charters lead to better plans
‚úÖ Users feel their vision is comprehensively captured
