# AI Agent Directives

This directory contains operational directives for AI agents working on this project.

## Purpose

Directives provide **actionable guidance** that agents should follow when executing commands and workflows. They fill the gap between "feature exists" and "agent knows to use it."

## How to Use Directives

1. **Read directives BEFORE executing core commands**
2. **Follow the recommended workflows** for each command type
3. **Suggest intelligent options** to users when applicable
4. **Reference directives** when explaining your decisions

## Directive Files

- `core_commands.md` - Guidelines for charter, plan, align, validate
- `vision_interrogation.md` - When and how to use vision interrogation
- `planning_workflow.md` - Intelligent planning with codebase analysis
- `gate_system.md` - How to properly handle AI agent gates
- `best_practices.md` - General principles and patterns

## Agent Responsibilities

As an AI agent, you should:

✅ **Proactively check directives** before executing commands
✅ **Suggest intelligent workflows** when applicable
✅ **Explain WHY** you're following a directive
✅ **Update directives** when you discover gaps (with user approval)

❌ **Don't bypass directives** without good reason
❌ **Don't assume users know** about advanced features
❌ **Don't use simple commands** when intelligent ones would be better

## Priority Order

1. **User explicit request** - Always honor what user asks
2. **Directives** - Follow these guidelines
3. **System defaults** - Fall back to basic behavior

## Questions?

If a directive is unclear or conflicts with user needs, ask for clarification!
