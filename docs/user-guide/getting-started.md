## 🎯 Step 2: Create Your Project Vision (5 minutes)

Every successful project starts with a clear vision. AI Onboard's **charter** command helps you define this foundation.

### Interactive Charter Creation
```bash
python -m ai_onboard charter
```

This interactive process will guide you through:

#### Vision Core Questions
- **What problem does your project solve?**
  - Example: "Create a user-friendly task management app for remote teams"
  
- **What is your ideal outcome?**
  - Example: "Teams can collaborate 50% more effectively with intuitive task tracking"

- **Who are your primary users?**
  - Example: "Remote development teams of 5-20 people"

#### Success Criteria
- **How will you measure success?**
  - Example: "User satisfaction >4.5/5, 80% feature adoption rate"

- **What are your key constraints?**
  - Example: "6-month timeline, mobile-first design, GDPR compliance"

### Charter Example Output
```yaml
project_name: "TeamFlow - Remote Task Management"
vision_statement: "Empower remote teams with intuitive, collaborative task management"
problem_statement: "Remote teams struggle with fragmented task tracking and communication"
success_criteria:
  - "User satisfaction score >4.5/5"
  - "80% feature adoption within 3 months"
  - "50% improvement in team collaboration metrics"
stakeholders:
  - "Development Team (primary users)"
  - "Product Manager (decision maker)"
  - "End Users (remote teams)"
```
