# Cursor AI Integration Strategy

## Problem Statement

The AI Agent Oversight & Guardrails system is currently **built but not actively integrated** with Cursor AI agents. The system can monitor and control operations, but Cursor AI agents don't automatically route their operations through the oversight system.

## Current Limitations

### 1. **No Real-Time Interception**
- Cursor AI agents execute tool calls directly through the IDE
- File operations, terminal commands, and edits happen without oversight system involvement
- The system is "passive" - it can detect but not prevent

### 2. **No Agent Communication Protocol**
- Cursor agents don't "know" about the oversight system
- No standardized way for agents to request approval before operations
- No feedback loop from oversight system to agent

### 3. **Post-Facto Monitoring Only**
- Agent Activity Monitor detects activity after it happens
- Chaos Detection triggers after problems occur
- Gates are created but agents can bypass them unintentionally

## Integration Approaches

### **Approach 1: Cursor Rules Integration (Immediate, Lightweight)**

**Mechanism**: Use `.cursorrules` to instruct agents to voluntarily check gates

**Advantages**:
- No code changes required
- Works immediately
- Agents can self-regulate

**Limitations**:
- Relies on agent compliance (not enforced)
- Agents might forget or ignore rules
- No hard blocking

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# .cursorrules addition

## MANDATORY GATE CHECKS

Before executing ANY of the following operations, you MUST:
1. Call `python -m ai_onboard integrator process <agent_id> <operation>`
2. Wait for approval response
3. Only proceed if approved

**Operations requiring gate check**:
- Creating/deleting 5+ files
- Refactoring 3+ files
- Adding dependencies
- Major architectural changes
- Bulk operations

**How to check**:
\`\`\`python
# Example: Check if file creation is allowed
python -m ai_onboard integrator process cursor_ai "create_10_files" --context '{"files": ["file1.py", "file2.py", ...]}'
\`\`\`

If BLOCKED, you must:
- Stop the operation immediately
- Report blocking reasons to the user
- Ask for guidance

If APPROVED, proceed with the operation.
```

### **Approach 2: Python Context Manager Integration (Medium Effort, Better Control)**

**Mechanism**: Provide Python decorators/context managers that agents can use

**Advantages**:
- Programmatic enforcement
- Clear API for agents
- Can be used in scripts and automation

**Limitations**:
- Requires agents to use Python code
- Not applicable to direct tool calls
- Still relies on agent cooperation

**Implementation**:
```python
# ai_onboard/core/ai_integration/agent_context.py

from contextlib import contextmanager
from typing import Dict, Any

@contextmanager
def with_oversight(agent_id: str, operation: str, context: Dict[str, Any]):
    """
    Context manager for agent operations requiring oversight.
    
    Usage:
        with with_oversight("cursor_ai", "create_files", {"count": 10}):
            # Create files here
            for i in range(10):
                Path(f"file{i}.py").touch()
    """
    from .system_integrator import get_system_integrator
    from pathlib import Path
    
    integrator = get_system_integrator(Path.cwd())
    result = integrator.process_agent_operation(agent_id, operation, context)
    
    if not result.approved:
        raise OversightBlockedException(
            f"Operation blocked: {', '.join(result.blocking_reasons)}",
            corrective_actions=result.corrective_actions
        )
    
    yield result  # Approved, proceed
    
    # Log completion
    integrator.activity_monitor.log_agent_action(
        agent_id=agent_id,
        action=operation,
        context=context,
        success=True
    )

class OversightBlockedException(Exception):
    """Raised when an operation is blocked by oversight system."""
    def __init__(self, message, corrective_actions=None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.corrective_actions = corrective_actions or []
```

**Agent Usage**:
```python
from ai_onboard.core.ai_integration.agent_context import with_oversight

# Agent code
try:
    with with_oversight("cursor_ai", "bulk_file_creation", {"count": 15}):
        # This will check oversight first
        for i in range(15):
            create_file(f"file{i}.py")
except OversightBlockedException as e:
    print(f"Operation blocked: {e}")
    print("Corrective actions:")
    for action in e.corrective_actions:
        print(f"  - {action}")
    # Ask user for guidance
```

### **Approach 3: File System Watcher Integration (High Effort, True Enforcement)**

**Mechanism**: Monitor file system and block operations before they complete

**Advantages**:
- True enforcement (can prevent operations)
- Works regardless of agent cooperation
- Catches all file operations

**Limitations**:
- Complex implementation
- OS-specific
- Performance overhead
- May conflict with IDE operations

**Implementation**:
```python
# ai_onboard/core/ai_integration/fs_guard.py

import os
import sys
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

class OversightFileSystemGuard(FileSystemEventHandler):
    """
    File system watcher that enforces oversight rules.
    
    This guards against unauthorized file operations by:
    1. Detecting file creation/deletion/modification
    2. Checking against oversight system
    3. Reverting unauthorized operations
    """
    
    def on_created(self, event):
        if self._is_agent_operation(event):
            allowed = self._check_oversight("file_creation", event.src_path)
            if not allowed:
                # Revert the operation
                os.remove(event.src_path)
                self._notify_user(f"Blocked file creation: {event.src_path}")
    
    def on_deleted(self, event):
        # Similar logic for deletions
        pass
```

### **Approach 4: Cursor Extension/Plugin (Ideal, High Effort)**

**Mechanism**: Build a Cursor extension that intercepts agent operations

**Advantages**:
- True integration with Cursor
- Can intercept all agent operations
- Native UI integration
- Best user experience

**Limitations**:
- Requires Cursor extension development
- May require Cursor API changes
- High development effort
- Dependent on Cursor's extension architecture

**Status**: Not feasible currently (Cursor extension API not available)

## Recommended Implementation Path

### **Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1) - Cursor Rules Integration**

1. **Update `.cursorrules`** with mandatory gate check instructions
2. **Add agent instruction prompts** that appear before major operations
3. **Create quick reference guide** for agents on gate checking
4. **Test with real agent sessions**

**Deliverable**: Agents voluntarily check gates before major operations

### **Phase 2: Short-Term (Weeks 2-3) - Python Context Manager**

1. **Build `agent_context.py`** with context managers and decorators
2. **Create agent helper functions** for common operations
3. **Add automatic operation detection** (detect when agents should use context managers)
4. **Update documentation** with Python examples

**Deliverable**: Agents can use Python code to enforce oversight

### **Phase 3: Medium-Term (Weeks 4-6) - Enhanced Monitoring & Feedback**

1. **Build agent feedback loop** - Dashboard updates visible to agents
2. **Add agent notification system** - Alerts when gates are created
3. **Implement smart defaults** - Pre-approve safe operations
4. **Create agent learning system** - Learn agent patterns and preferences

**Deliverable**: System provides real-time feedback to agents

### **Phase 4: Long-Term (Future) - File System Guard**

1. **Research OS-specific file monitoring**
2. **Build prototype file system guard**
3. **Test performance and reliability**
4. **Integrate with oversight system**

**Deliverable**: True enforcement of file operation limits

## Testing Strategy

### **Test Scenario 1: Agent Creates 10 Files**
1. Agent attempts to create 10 files
2. Agent checks with integrator first
3. Hard limits enforcer blocks (exceeds max_files_per_hour)
4. Agent receives blocking reason
5. Agent asks user for override
6. User grants override
7. Agent proceeds with creation

### **Test Scenario 2: Agent Refactors Core Files**
1. Agent plans to refactor 5 core files
2. Agent checks with integrator
3. Hard gate enforcer blocks (off-track from WBS)
4. Agent receives corrective actions
5. Agent proposes alternative approach
6. User approves alternative
7. Agent proceeds with approved approach

### **Test Scenario 3: Emergency Agent Stop**
1. Agent exhibits chaotic behavior (rapid changes)
2. Chaos detector triggers emergency
3. Emergency control system pauses agent
4. Dashboard shows paused status
5. User reviews agent actions
6. User resumes or stops agent

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Update `.cursorrules` with gate check instructions
- [ ] Create `agent_context.py` with context managers
- [ ] Add `OversightBlockedException` class
- [ ] Update dashboard to show agent status in real-time
- [ ] Create agent helper functions module
- [ ] Add automatic operation detection
- [ ] Build agent feedback notification system
- [ ] Test with real Cursor AI sessions
- [ ] Document agent integration guide
- [ ] Create video tutorial for agents

## Success Metrics

1. **Agent Compliance Rate**: % of major operations that check gates
2. **Blocking Effectiveness**: % of unauthorized operations prevented
3. **False Positive Rate**: % of legitimate operations blocked incorrectly
4. **User Intervention Rate**: How often users need to manually approve/reject
5. **System Performance**: Overhead added by oversight system

## Open Questions

1. **How do we make agents "remember" to check gates?**
   - Cursor rules repetition?
   - Pre-operation prompts?
   - Automatic reminders?

2. **What happens when an agent is blocked mid-operation?**
   - Rollback mechanism?
   - Partial completion handling?
   - State recovery?

3. **How do we handle agent forgetfulness?**
   - Post-facto detection and notification?
   - Learning from patterns?
   - Smart defaults?

4. **What's the right balance between control and productivity?**
   - Too many gates = agent can't work
   - Too few gates = no oversight
   - Adaptive gating based on trust?

## Conclusion

The current system provides the **infrastructure** for agent oversight, but needs **integration work** to make it functional with real Cursor AI agents. The recommended path is:

1. **Start with voluntary compliance** (Cursor rules)
2. **Add programmatic enforcement** (Python context managers)
3. **Build towards true enforcement** (File system guard)

This gives us immediate value while working towards comprehensive control.
