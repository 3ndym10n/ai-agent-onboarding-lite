# Vision Interrogation System

## Overview

The Vision Interrogation System is a comprehensive foundation-building tool that **halts AI agent progress** until the project vision is clearly defined and a strong foundation is established. This system ensures that all AI agent work is built on a solid understanding of the project's core purpose, goals, and constraints.

## Why Vision Interrogation?

### The Problem
- AI agents often start working without clear direction
- Projects lack foundational vision documents
- Scope creep and misalignment are common
- Technical decisions are made without business context
- User needs and success criteria are unclear

### The Solution
The Vision Interrogation System:
- **Forces** clear vision definition before AI work begins
- **Guides** users through comprehensive foundation building
- **Validates** that the foundation is strong enough for AI agents
- **Prevents** scope drift and misalignment
- **Ensures** all decisions align with project vision

## How It Works

### 1. Vision Readiness Check
Before any AI agent work, the system checks if the project has a clear, well-defined vision:

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate check
```

This returns:
- **Ready for AI agents**: Boolean indicating if AI work can proceed
- **Vision clarity score**: 0.0-1.0 score of vision definition quality
- **Blocking issues**: List of issues preventing AI agent work
- **Interrogation status**: Whether interrogation has been completed

### 2. Interrogation Process
If vision is unclear, the system guides users through a structured interrogation:

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate start
```

The interrogation covers four key phases:

#### Phase 1: Vision Core
- **Core Problem**: What problem does this project solve?
- **Vision Statement**: What is the ideal outcome?
- **Primary Users**: Who are the beneficiaries?

#### Phase 2: Stakeholders & Goals
- **Key Stakeholders**: Who are the decision makers?
- **Stakeholder Goals**: What does each stakeholder want?

#### Phase 3: Scope & Boundaries
- **In Scope**: What is definitely included?
- **Out of Scope**: What is definitely excluded?

#### Phase 4: Success & Metrics
- **Success Criteria**: How will success be measured?
- **Minimum Viable Outcomes**: What must be achieved?

### 3. Response Submission
Users submit detailed responses to each question:

```bash
python -m ai_onboard interrogate submit
```

The system:
- Validates response quality
- Identifies ambiguities
- Generates insights
- Tracks progress

### 4. Completion Validation
The system ensures all required elements are defined before allowing AI agent work to proceed.

## Key Features

### Smart Data Collection
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers all critical foundation elements
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures responses meet quality standards
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies unclear or incomplete responses
- **Progressive Guidance**: Guides users through complex questions

### Ambiguity Management
The system distinguishes between:
- **Critical Ambiguities**: Must be resolved before AI work
- **Technical Ambiguities**: Acceptable if core vision is strong
- **Scope Ambiguities**: Should be documented for future resolution

### Foundation Strength Assessment
Evaluates:
- **Vision Clarity**: How well-defined is the core vision?
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Are all stakeholders identified?
- **Scope Definition**: Are boundaries clearly set?
- **Success Metrics**: Are outcomes measurable?

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Project
```bash
# 1. Check if vision is ready
python -m ai_onboard interrogate check

# 2. If not ready, start interrogation
python -m ai_onboard interrogate start

# 3. Submit responses to questions
python -m ai_onboard interrogate submit

# 4. Check progress
python -m ai_onboard interrogate questions

# 5. Get summary when complete
python -m ai_onboard interrogate summary
```

### For AI Agents
```bash
# Before starting any work, check vision readiness
python -m ai_onboard interrogate check

# If not ready, guide user through interrogation
python -m ai_onboard interrogate start

# Only proceed when vision is clear
```

## Quality Standards

### Response Requirements
- **Minimum Length**: 20 characters for meaningful responses
- **Recommended Length**: 50+ characters for comprehensive answers
- **Confidence Level**: 0.7+ for most responses
- **Detail Level**: Sufficient to guide AI agent decisions

### Completion Criteria
- **All Required Questions**: Must be answered
- **Vision Clarity Score**: Must be >= 0.8
- **Critical Ambiguities**: Must be resolved
- **Foundation Strength**: Must be "strong" or "moderate"

## Integration with AI Agents

### Pre-Work Checklist
AI agents must check:
1. Vision readiness status
2. Interrogation completion
3. Vision clarity score
4. Blocking issues
5. Critical ambiguity resolution

### Work Blocking Conditions
AI agents are blocked when:
- Interrogation is incomplete
- Vision clarity score is too low
- Critical ambiguities remain unresolved
- Foundation strength is weak

### Progressive Guidance
The system provides step-by-step guidance:
1. Check current vision state
2. Identify missing elements
3. Guide through interrogation
4. Validate completion
5. Allow AI work to proceed

## Emergency Procedures

### Vision Crisis
If vision foundation is compromised:
1. Immediately halt all AI agent work
2. Assess vision foundation damage
3. Restart interrogation if needed
4. Rebuild vision documents
5. Validate before resuming

### Interrogation Failure
If interrogation process fails:
1. Document failure reasons
2. Provide alternative approaches
3. Escalate to human review
4. Consider force completion
5. Update process for future

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning Opportunities
- Analyze interrogation effectiveness
- Identify common blocking issues
- Improve question quality
- Enhance guidance systems
- Optimize completion criteria

### Process Enhancement
- Refine question sets
- Improve response validation
- Enhance ambiguity detection
- Strengthen quality metrics
- Streamline completion process

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clear Direction**: Understand exactly what the project should achieve
- **Reduced Scope Creep**: Clear boundaries prevent feature bloat
- **Better Decisions**: Technical choices align with business goals
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Everyone understands the vision

### For AI Agents
- **Clear Context**: Know exactly what they're building and why
- **Aligned Decisions**: All choices support the project vision
- **Reduced Errors**: Less likely to build the wrong thing
- **Efficient Work**: Focus on the right problems

### For Projects
- **Strong Foundation**: Built on clear vision and goals
- **Reduced Risk**: Less chance of building the wrong solution
- **Better Outcomes**: Higher success rate and user satisfaction
- **Faster Development**: Clear direction speeds up decision-making

## Conclusion

The Vision Interrogation System transforms how projects are initiated and how AI agents work. By ensuring a strong foundation before any AI work begins, it prevents misalignment, reduces scope creep, and dramatically improves project success rates.

The system is designed to be:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all critical foundation elements
- **Intelligent**: Adapts to project complexity and user needs
- **Enforcing**: Prevents AI work without proper foundation
- **Guiding**: Helps users build strong foundations
- **Validating**: Ensures quality before proceeding

This creates a new paradigm where AI agents are not just tools, but partners in building successful, well-aligned projects that truly serve their intended purpose.
