## Learning Mechanisms

### User Preference Learning

The system learns from user interactions and preferences:

```python
# Example: Learning from gate timeout preferences
system.record_learning_event(
    learning_type=LearningType.USER_PREFERENCE,
    context={
        "user_id": "user123",
        "preference_type": "gate_timeout",
        "current_value": 30,
        "user_feedback": "too_long"
    },
    outcome={
        "preferred_value": 2,
        "satisfaction_score": 0.9,
        "improvement": 0.7
    },
    confidence=0.95,
    impact_score=0.8,
    source="gate_system"
)
```

### Performance Optimization Learning

The system learns from performance metrics and optimizations:

```python
# Example: Learning from performance optimizations
system.record_learning_event(
    learning_type=LearningType.PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION,
    context={
        "operation_type": "vision_interrogation",
        "project_type": "web_application",
        "performance_metrics": {
            "execution_time": 2.5,
            "memory_usage": 45.2,
            "cpu_usage": 12.8
        }
    },
    outcome={
        "optimization_result": {
            "success": True,
            "improvement": 35.0,
            "new_execution_time": 1.6
        }
    },
    confidence=0.9,
    impact_score=0.7,
    source="performance_monitor"
)
```

### Error Pattern Learning

The system learns from error patterns and solutions:

```python
# Example: Learning from error solutions
system.record_learning_event(
    learning_type=LearningType.ERROR_PATTERN,
    context={
        "error_type": "ImportError",
        "error_context": {
            "module": "ai_onboard.core.enhanced_vision",
            "function": "start_interrogation",
            "line": 45
        }
    },
    outcome={
        "solution": "Add missing import statement",
        "solution_effectiveness": 0.95,
        "prevention_strategy": "Add import validation"
    },
    confidence=0.9,
    impact_score=0.8,
    source="smart_debugger"
)
```

## Recommendation Generation

### Automatic Recommendation Generation

The system automatically generates recommendations based on learning events:

1. **User Preference Recommendations**: Generated when user satisfaction is low
2. **Performance Recommendations**: Generated when optimizations are successful
3. **Error Prevention Recommendations**: Generated when solutions are highly effective
4. **Workflow Adaptation Recommendations**: Generated when usage patterns suggest automation opportunities
5. **System Health Recommendations**: Generated when health metrics indicate issues

### Recommendation Prioritization

Recommendations are prioritized based on:

- **Expected Impact**: How much improvement is expected
- **Confidence**: How confident the system is in the recommendation
- **Implementation Effort**: How much effort is required to implement
- **User Satisfaction**: How it affects user satisfaction
- **System Health**: How it affects system health

### Recommendation Implementation

Recommendations can be implemented automatically or manually:

```python
# Automatic implementation (for low-risk changes)
result = system.implement_recommendation("rec_1234567890_abcdef12")

# Manual approval workflow
recommendation = system.get_improvement_recommendations(limit=1)[0]
if recommendation.priority >= 8:
    # High priority - implement automatically
    system.implement_recommendation(recommendation.recommendation_id)
else:
    # Medium priority - require approval
    print(f"Recommendation requires approval: {recommendation.description}")
```

## System Health Monitoring

### Health Metrics

The system continuously monitors:

- **Performance Score**: Overall system performance (0-1)
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of errors (0-1)
- **User Satisfaction**: User satisfaction scores (0-1)
- **System Uptime**: System availability (0-1)
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Component Health**: Health of individual system components

### Health Thresholds

- **Performance Score**: < 0.7 triggers optimization recommendations
- **Error Rate**: > 0.1 triggers error prevention recommendations
- **User Satisfaction**: < 0.6 triggers UX improvement recommendations
- **System Uptime**: < 0.95 triggers reliability recommendations

### Self-Healing

The system can automatically implement self-healing measures:

```python
# Example: Automatic performance optimization
if health_record.performance_score < 0.7:
    system.record_learning_event(
        learning_type=LearningType.SYSTEM_HEALTH,
        context={
            "health_metrics": {
                "performance_score": health_record.performance_score,
                "bottlenecks": ["vision_interrogation", "gate_system"]
            }
        },
        outcome={
            "health_issues": {
                "bottlenecks": ["vision_interrogation", "gate_system"],
                "recommendations": ["optimize_vision_interrogation", "reduce_gate_timeout"]
            }
        },
        confidence=0.9,
        impact_score=0.8,
        source="health_monitor"
    )
```

## Knowledge Base Evolution

### Project Type Knowledge

The system builds knowledge about different project types:

```python
# Example: Learning about web application projects
system.record_learning_event(
    learning_type=LearningType.PROJECT_TYPE,
    context={
        "project_type": "web_application",
        "project_characteristics": {
            "framework": "django",
            "database": "postgresql",
            "frontend": "react",
            "deployment": "docker"
        }
    },
    outcome={
        "success_indicators": {
            "vision_clarity": 0.9,
            "stakeholder_alignment": 0.85,
            "technical_feasibility": 0.8
        }
    },
    confidence=0.8,
    impact_score=0.6,
    source="project_analysis"
)
```

### Best Practices Learning

The system learns and evolves best practices:

```python
# Example: Learning best practices for vision interrogation
system.record_learning_event(
    learning_type=LearningType.USAGE_PATTERN,
    context={
        "user_id": "user123",
        "usage_pattern": {
            "type": "vision_interrogation_flow",
            "steps": ["start", "answer_questions", "review", "confirm"],
            "time_spent": 15.5,
