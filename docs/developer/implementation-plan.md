# AI-Onboard Implementation Plan: Getting Back on Track

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to get the `ai-onboard` system back on track to achieve its original vision: **a drop-in project coach that maintains clarity and continuity between context windows, prevents agent and user drift, and ensures all decisions align with project vision**.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working ✅
- **Core Architecture**: Solid foundation with modular design
