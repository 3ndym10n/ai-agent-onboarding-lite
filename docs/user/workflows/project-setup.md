## 🚀 Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Project Charter Creation (8-12 minutes)

The charter defines your project's **why**, **what**, and **who** - the foundation everything else builds on.

#### Interactive Charter Creation
```bash
python -m ai_onboard charter
```

#### What to Expect
The system will guide you through a structured interrogation process:

##### Vision Core Questions
**Q: What problem does this project solve?**
- Be specific about the pain point
- Focus on user/business impact
- Example: *"Remote teams struggle with fragmented task tracking across 5+ tools, leading to 30% time waste on coordination"*

**Q: What is your ideal outcome?**
- Describe the perfect end state
- Include measurable benefits
- Example: *"Teams collaborate seamlessly in one platform, reducing coordination time by 60% and improving delivery speed by 40%"*

**Q: Who are your primary users?**
- Define your target audience clearly
- Include their key characteristics
- Example: *"Remote development teams of 5-20 people, tech-savvy, using agile methodologies"*

##### Success Criteria Definition
**Q: How will you measure success?**
- Define 3-5 measurable criteria
- Include both quantitative and qualitative metrics
- Example:
  - *"User satisfaction score >4.5/5"*
  - *"80% feature adoption within 3 months"*
  - *"50% reduction in coordination time"*
  - *"90% user retention after 6 months"*

**Q: What are your key constraints?**
- Time, budget, technical limitations
- Regulatory or compliance requirements
- Example: *"6-month timeline, $50k budget, GDPR compliance, mobile-first design"*

##### Stakeholder Mapping
**Q: Who are your key stakeholders?**
- Decision makers, users, influencers
- Their roles and expectations
- Example:
  - *"Product Manager (final decisions, ROI focus)"*
  - *"Development Team (implementation, technical quality)"*
  - *"End Users (usability, feature needs)"*
  - *"Executive Sponsor (strategic alignment, budget)"*

#### Charter Quality Validation
The system automatically validates your charter for:
- **Vision Clarity**: Clear, compelling vision statement
- **Measurable Goals**: Specific, achievable success criteria
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Well-defined roles and expectations
- **Constraint Reality**: Realistic timeline and resource constraints

#### Example Charter Output
