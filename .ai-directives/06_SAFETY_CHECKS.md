# üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY CHECKS - MANDATORY SAFETY VALIDATION

## MANDATORY SAFETY VALIDATION

You **MUST** perform safety checks on all development work before execution.

## SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

**BEFORE ANY CHANGES**:
1. **VALIDATE**: Check for safety risks and potential issues
2. **BACKUP**: Ensure changes are reversible
3. **TEST**: Validate changes in safe environment
4. **MONITOR**: Watch for unexpected side effects

## SAFETY CHECK CATEGORIES

**Code Safety**:
- Syntax validation and error checking
- Import validation and dependency checking
- File permission and access validation
- Resource usage and performance validation

**System Safety**:
- File system integrity checks
- Database and data safety validation
- Network and security validation
- User permission and access validation

**Operation Safety**:
- Command validation and safety checking
- Tool usage validation and error prevention
- Workflow validation and consistency checking
- Rollback and recovery validation

## SAFETY VALIDATION WORKFLOW

**MANDATORY STEPS**:
1. **RISK ASSESSMENT**: Evaluate potential risks
2. **SAFETY VALIDATION**: Run safety checks
3. **BACKUP CREATION**: Ensure reversibility
4. **TESTING**: Validate in safe environment
5. **MONITORING**: Watch for issues

## SAFETY COMMANDS

**MANDATORY SAFETY COMMANDS**:
```bash
# Run safety validation
python -m ai_onboard safety validate

# Check for risks
python -m ai_onboard safety check --risk-level high

# Create backup
python -m ai_onboard safety backup --reason "before_changes"

# Monitor system
python -m ai_onboard safety monitor --watch
```

## SAFETY VIOLATIONS

**NEVER**:
- Make changes without safety validation
- Ignore safety warnings or errors
- Work without proper backups
- Skip testing and validation steps

## SAFETY REPORTING

You **MUST** report:
- Safety checks performed
- Risks identified and mitigated
- Backups created and verified
- Testing results and validation

## CONFIRMATION

Type **"SAFETY_VALIDATED"** to confirm you understand the safety validation requirements.
