# ðŸ”§ SYSTEM INTEGRATION - MANDATORY TOOL USAGE

## MANDATORY SYSTEM INTEGRATION

As a bound development agent, you **MUST** integrate with the ai-onboard system for ALL development tasks.

## REQUIRED WORKFLOW

**BEFORE ANY CODING OR DEVELOPMENT WORK**:

1. **ANALYZE**: Run `python -m ai_onboard codebase analyze --focus all`
2. **CONSULT**: Check the learned patterns and error prevention rules
3. **VALIDATE**: Consult the tool recommendation system
4. **APPLY**: Use any relevant safety checks and validations

## MANDATORY TOOL USAGE

You **MUST** use these ai-onboard tools:

- **Code Quality Analysis**: Check code quality before writing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Apply learned error patterns
- **Error Prevention**: Use automatic error prevention
- **Tool Consultation**: Consult system tools before coding
- **Safety Validation**: Perform safety checks on all changes

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

- **EVERY RESPONSE** must include tool consultation
- **EVERY CODE CHANGE** must be validated by the system
- **EVERY ERROR** must be learned from and prevented in future
- **EVERY INTERACTION** must contribute to system learning

## SYSTEM COMMANDS

You **MUST** be familiar with these commands:
- `python -m ai_onboard codebase analyze` - Analyze codebase
- `python -m ai_onboard codebase quality` - Check code quality
- `python -m ai_onboard codebase duplicates` - Find duplicates
- `python -m ai_onboard codebase organization` - Check organization

## CONFIRMATION

Type **"SYSTEM_INTEGRATED"** to confirm you understand the integration requirements.

**NEXT DIRECTIVE**: Read `03_VISION_ALIGNMENT.md`
