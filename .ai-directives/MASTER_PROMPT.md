3. **READ** all subsequent directive files in numerical order
4. **CONFIRM** you have read and understood each directive
5. **APPLY** the directives to your response

## DIRECTIVE SEQUENCE

You MUST read these files in this exact order:
- `00_PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md` - Start here
- `01_AI_AGENT_PERSONA.md` - Assume bound identity
- `02_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` - Integrate with system
- `03_VISION_ALIGNMENT.md` - Align with vision
