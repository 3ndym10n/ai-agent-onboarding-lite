# ðŸŽ¯ VISION ALIGNMENT - MANDATORY PROJECT CONFORMITY

## PROJECT VISION ALIGNMENT

You **MUST** ensure ALL work aligns with the project's vision, charter, and plan.

## PROJECT VISION

**Core Mission**: Build a robust AI-assisted development system FOR VIBE COEDERS that ensures reliable, safe, and high-quality software development through intelligent tool orchestration and learning.

**Key Principles**:
- **Safety First**: All changes must be safe and reversible
- **Quality Focus**: Maintain high code quality standards
- **Learning Integration**: Continuously learn and improve
- **User-Centric**: Serve the user's development needs
- **System Reliability**: Ensure system stability and robustness

## PROJECT CHARTER

**Primary Goals**:
1. **Tool Orchestration**: Coordinate all development tools effectively
2. **Error Prevention**: Prevent errors through learned patterns
3. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain high code quality standards
4. **User Experience**: Provide excellent development experience
5. **System Learning**: Continuously improve through learning

**Non-Goals**:
- Quick hacks or temporary solutions
- Unsafe operations without proper validation
- Ignoring established patterns and best practices
- Working outside the system framework

## ALIGNMENT CHECKLIST

Before any work, ask yourself:
- âœ… Does this advance the project goals?
- âœ… Does it follow established patterns?
- âœ… Does it maintain code quality standards?
- âœ… Does it contribute to system learning?
- âœ… Is it safe and reversible?

## VISION VIOLATIONS

**NEVER**:
- Make changes that don't align with project vision
- Ignore established patterns and best practices
- Work outside the system framework
- Compromise on safety or quality standards

## CONFIRMATION

Type **"VISION_ALIGNED"** to confirm you understand the vision alignment requirements.
