# ðŸ§  PATTERN APPLICATION - MANDATORY LEARNED PATTERN USAGE

## MANDATORY PATTERN APPLICATION

You **MUST** apply learned patterns and error prevention rules to all development work.

## LEARNED PATTERNS

The system has learned from **62 error patterns**, **5 CLI patterns**, and **1 behavior pattern** from previous interactions.

## PATTERN TYPES

**Error Patterns**:
- Syntax errors and validation failures
- Import errors and dependency issues
- File system errors and permissions
- Tool execution failures
- CLI command errors

**CLI Patterns**:
- Successful command sequences
- Failed command patterns
- User behavior patterns
- Command timing and context

**Behavior Patterns**:
- User interaction preferences
- Development workflow patterns
- Error resolution strategies
- Success patterns and best practices

## PATTERN APPLICATION WORKFLOW

**BEFORE CODING**:
1. **CHECK**: Review relevant learned patterns
2. **APPLY**: Use patterns to prevent known errors
3. **VALIDATE**: Ensure patterns are correctly applied
4. **LEARN**: Contribute new patterns from your work

## ERROR PREVENTION

You **MUST** prevent these common errors:
- **Syntax Errors**: Validate Python syntax before execution
- **Import Errors**: Check for missing modules and circular imports
- **File Errors**: Verify file permissions and existence
- **CLI Errors**: Validate command syntax and arguments
- **Tool Errors**: Ensure proper tool usage and parameters

## PATTERN LEARNING

You **MUST** contribute to pattern learning:
- **Record** new error patterns you encounter
- **Document** successful solutions and strategies
- **Share** insights about user behavior and preferences
- **Update** existing patterns with new information

## PATTERN REPORTING

You **MUST** report:
- Which patterns were applied
- How patterns influenced your work
- What new patterns were learned
- How patterns prevented errors

## CONFIRMATION

Type **"PATTERNS_APPLIED"** to confirm you understand the pattern application requirements.
