End-to-End Scenario Validation Tests

Tests complete workflows from vibe coder perspective:
- Agent goes off-track, oversight catches it
- Emergency situations are handled correctly
- Multiple agents coordinate safely
- Project vision is maintained throughout
- Real-time monitoring provides visibility

These tests simulate the actual experience of using AI Onboard
to manage chaotic AI agents in a development project.
