# üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTED ONBOARDING FILES

**THESE FILES MUST NEVER BE DELETED - THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR AI STABILITY**

## üö® CRITICAL FILES (NEVER DELETE)

### **Core Onboarding System:**
1. `README.md` - Main onboarding guide (45-minute path)
2. `AI_HANDOVER_PROTOCOL.md` - Mandatory protocol for all AI models
3. `PROJECT_STATUS_TRACKER.md` - Current project status (auto-updated)
4. `PRIORITY_IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` - Task sequence and priorities

### **Essential Documentation:**
5. `PROJECT_ONBOARDING_PACKAGE.md` - Master onboarding guide
6. `HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary for AI transitions
7. `PROJECT_VISION_SUMMARY.md` - One-page project essence
8. `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level system design
9. `TECHNICAL_METHODOLOGIES.md` - Detailed implementation methods
10. `DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md` - Coding patterns and standards
11. `API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - External service integrations

### **Automation & Stability:**
12. `PROGRESS_AUTOMATION.py` - Automated status tracking system
13. `SCOPE_CHANGE_DETECTOR.py` - Scope change detection and management
14. `INTELLIGENT_ERROR_RESOLVER.py` - Loop prevention and error resolution
15. `ENHANCED_FILE_PROTECTION.py` - File protection system
16. `ENHANCED_CLEANUP_SYSTEM.py` - Protected cleanup system

### **Data & History:**
17. `progress_database.json` - Progress tracking data
18. `scope_history.json` - Scope change history
19. `PROTECTED_FILES.md` - This file (protection list)

## üö® **AI MODEL RULES:**

### **NEVER DELETE:**
- ‚ùå Any file listed above
- ‚ùå Any file in the onboarding/ directory
- ‚ùå Any file that contains "onboarding" in its name
- ‚ùå Any file that contains "progress" in its name
- ‚ùå Any file that contains "status" in its name
- ‚ùå Any file that contains "protection" in its name
- ‚ùå Any file that contains "handover" in its name

### **ALWAYS PRESERVE:**
- ‚úÖ The onboarding system integrity
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking functionality
- ‚úÖ AI handover protocols
- ‚úÖ Status automation systems
- ‚úÖ File protection systems

## üõ°Ô∏è **ENHANCED PROTECTION SYSTEM:**

### **Automatic Protection:**
- **Backup Creation:** All critical files are automatically backed up
- **Pattern Matching:** Files matching protected patterns are blocked
- **Violation Logging:** All protection violations are logged
- **Emergency Restore:** Automatic restoration from backups

### **Cleanup Integration:**
- **Protected Cleanup:** Use `ENHANCED_CLEANUP_SYSTEM.py` for safe cleanup
- **Validation:** All deletions are validated against protection rules
- **Dry Run:** Always run cleanup in dry-run mode first
- **Violation Detection:** Protection violations are immediately detected and blocked

## üéØ **PURPOSE:**

These files ensure:
1. **AI Continuity** - Seamless handovers between AI models
2. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time status updates
3. **Loop Prevention** - Intelligent error resolution
4. **Scope Management** - Change detection and adaptation
5. **Zero Knowledge Loss** - Complete project understanding

## üö® **CONSEQUENCES OF DELETION:**

If any of these files are deleted:
- ‚ùå AI models will lose project context
- ‚ùå Progress tracking will break
- ‚ùå Handover protocols will fail
- ‚ùå Endless loops may occur
- ‚ùå Project stability will be compromised

**üéØ REMEMBER: These files are the foundation of AI stability. They must be preserved at all costs!**
