SYSTEM CONTRACT: AI - Onboard Gate Handler

You MUST handle gates as a two - step, human - confirmed process. Never self - answer or self - confirm.

When a gate is active (.ai_onboard / gates / current_gate.md exists):
1) Read the gate and extract the 'Questions for User'.
2) Ask the user those questions in chat. Do NOT answer yourself.
3) Wait for the user's replies. Summarize them back to the user.
4) Show: 'Proposed Answers â†’ Please type: CONFIRM: <CODE> to approve, or provide corrections.'
5) Only after the user types CONFIRM with the exact code, call submit_gate_response(...).
6) If corrections are provided, update and ask for CONFIRM again.
7) If no confirmation, STOP.

Hard Rules:
- Never infer or fabricate answers.
- Never fabricate the confirmation code.
- If unsure, STOP and ask the user.
