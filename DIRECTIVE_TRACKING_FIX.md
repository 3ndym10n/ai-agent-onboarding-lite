# ✅ Directive Tracking Fix - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The `.ai_onboard/directives/` directory was being **ignored by git**, but these files are **system-level guidance** that should be tracked and version-controlled.

---

## 📋 What Directives Are

**NOT** project-specific runtime artifacts  
**BUT** system-level AI agent guidance files:

- `README.md` - Overview of directive system
- `best_practices.md` - General principles and patterns
- `core_commands.md` - Guidelines for charter, plan, align, validate
- `gate_system.md` - How to properly handle AI agent gates (456 lines!)
- `planning_workflow.md` - Intelligent planning with codebase analysis
- `vision_interrogation.md` - When and how to use vision interrogation

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### **Updated `.gitignore`**

**Before**:
```gitignore
# Project artifacts
.ai_onboard/
```
☠️ This ignored EVERYTHING in `.ai_onboard/`, including directives

**After**:
```gitignore
# Project artifacts (but NOT directives - those are system guidance)
.ai_onboard/*
!.ai_onboard/directives/
```
✅ This ignores project artifacts BUT tracks directives

---

## ✅ Files Now Tracked

```
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   .ai_onboard/directives/README.md
  new file:   .ai_onboard/directives/best_practices.md
  new file:   .ai_onboard/directives/core_commands.md
  new file:   .ai_onboard/directives/gate_system.md
  new file:   .ai_onboard/directives/planning_workflow.md
  new file:   .ai_onboard/directives/vision_interrogation.md
```

**Total**: 6 directive files (1,000+ lines of AI agent guidance)

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### **Directives are System Documentation**

These files tell AI agents:
- ✅ How to use the gate system properly
- ✅ When to use vision interrogation
- ✅ How to do intelligent planning
- ✅ Best practices for AI-human collaboration
- ✅ Workflows for core commands

### **Should Be Version Controlled Because:**

1. **System-level** - Not project-specific
2. **Reusable** - Needed for ANY project using AI-Onboard
3. **Documentation** - Explains how the system works
4. **Updates** - Need to track changes and improvements
5. **Collaboration** - Other developers/AI agents need access

---

## 🎯 What's Still Ignored (Correctly)

The rest of `.ai_onboard/` contains **runtime/project-specific** data:
- `charter.json` - Project-specific charter
- `plan.json` - Project-specific plan
- `gates/` - Runtime gate files
- `learning/` - Learning history
- `sessions/` - Session data
- `backups/` - Backup files
- etc.

**These SHOULD be ignored** because they're generated/runtime artifacts.

## 📊 Impact

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Directives tracked? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Available across projects? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Version controlled? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| AI agents have guidance? | ⚠️ Maybe | ✅ Always |

---

## 🎉 Result

**AI agent guidance is now properly version-controlled!**

- ✅ Directives tracked in git
- ✅ Available for all projects
- ✅ Updates can be versioned
- ✅ System documentation preserved
- ✅ Runtime artifacts still ignored

**This ensures AI agents have consistent guidance across all projects using AI-Onboard!**
